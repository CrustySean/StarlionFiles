That happens when you hear the rumble. If you press the sticks before, then a wrong calibration will get applied.\nTo fix that on the fly, simply remove the Joy-Con and re insert it. This always causes a new calibration. Just make sure you don't touch the stick when you reinsert.\n\n\uE016 I don't care about emuMMC/Linux/Android. Can the Part manager be used for something else?\nYes. You can still reformat your SD card to a single FAT32 partition.\nYou can even use it when you have exFAT and you want to format to FAT32.\nIt is also suggested to format your sd card via hekate. That's because it prepares it for performance. something that many partitioning tools neglect.\n",
